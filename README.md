### Hello World! 👋👋

嗨！ I'm Yikanji, an undergraduate student in Software Engineering at _[Xinjiang University](http://ss.xju.edu.cn/)_, and I once studied in _[Central South University](https://cse.csu.edu.cn/)_ as an exchange student.

Currently I am interested in NLP, especially Text Generation, but any field of computing for me is fascinating!
